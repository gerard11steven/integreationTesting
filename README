<-- readme for gerards git repository for integration setup -->

If you are reading this you are probably lost.
If you are reading this looking for help, i suggest you are looking in the wrong place, there are people who will be doing this much better then i will be.

Disclaimer: sometimes i have moments of brilliance and in which case this may end up being awesome.

Status and completion:
> 0.1 initial setup and readme addition
> 0.5 git and ant integration: ant file successful posts to git
> 0.6 ant and selenium integration successful: ant calls and runs selenium as required
> 0.7 added a perl script(running on active perl) to interface between the produced reports and the ant script
> 1.0 bug fixes between ant-selenium-perl-ant complete for cases of no repository change, successful test and failure case of the tests

-attempts to convert to production are more difficult then expected
